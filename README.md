# Bookmarklets
A collection of bookmarklets that I found (will update if I get new ideas or find new bookmarklets)


# IFrame
Loads most sites that don't have Same-origin policy enabled.
This bookmarklet is simple, it already has https:// protocol so all you have to do is enter url.
```js
javascript:(function(){var url=prompt("Enter URL Here (example: google.com)");if(url==null){alert('No URL Entered!')}else{document.body.innerHTML='<iframe src="https://' + url + '" style="position:fixed;top:0;bottom:0;left:0;right:0;width:100%;height:100%;border:none;margin:0;padding:0;z-index:999999;">Your browser does not support iframes</iframe>';alert('URL Loaded!');}}())
```

Getting a well-deserved update soon :)
### Update Plans
- [ ] Make a UI that lets the user choose between regular iframe or proxied iframe
- [ ] Add a bar on the top that shows when user loads iframe, has multiple features
- [ ] Make the script auto-update (load from raw github url)
